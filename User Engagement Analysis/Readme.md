## User Engagement Analysis
## Introduction
The User Engagement Analysis project aims to utilize SQL queries to delve into the engagement levels of users on a platform. 
This involves examining various metrics such as likes, comments, shares, and reactions on posts to understand user behavior and interaction patterns.

## Goal
The primary objectives of the User Engagement Analysis project include:

Retrieve Comprehensive Metrics: Develop SQL queries to retrieve the total count of likes, comments, and shares received by a specific post, identified by its unique post ID.

Calculate Mean Reactions: Formulate SQL queries to calculate the average number of reactions (likes, comments, shares) per distinct user within a defined time frame. 
This provides insights into the overall engagement level of users over time.

Identify Top Engaging Posts: Utilize SQL queries to identify the three most engaging posts within the preceding week, based on the aggregate sum of reactions (likes, comments, shares).

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the User Engagement Analysis project offers valuable insights into user behavior and engagement patterns on the platform. 
By leveraging SQL queries to analyze metrics such as likes, comments, shares, and reactions, stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance user experience, content strategy, and overall platform performance.
